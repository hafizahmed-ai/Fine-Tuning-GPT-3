{"prompt": "can I replace Badger 1 1/3 with a Badger 5 1/2 - with same connections? ->", "completion": "Plumbing connections will vary with different models. Usually the larger higher amp draw wil not affect the wiring, the disposals are designed to a basic standard setup common to all brands. They want you to buy their brand or version or model. As long as the disposal is UL listed, United Laboratories, they will setup and bolt up the same.\n"}
{"prompt": "Does this come with power cord and dishwasher hook up? ->", "completion": "It does not come with a power cord. It does come with the dishwasher hookup.\n"}
{"prompt": "loud noise inside when turned on. sounds like blades are loose ->", "completion": "Check if you dropped something inside.Usually my wife put lemons inside make a lot of noise and I will have to get them out using my hands or mechanical fingers .\n"}
{"prompt": "where is the reset button located ->", "completion": "on the bottom\n"}
{"prompt": "I have a badger 5 it is leaking water at bottom near reset bottom plus does a new one came with a ss ring for inside the sink ->", "completion": "If your garbage disposal is leaking out the bottom near the reset button, you most likely have a leak in the metal plate that is located directly under the blades. This plate is designed to protect the electrically powered parts of the motor (the rotor, the shaft, etc.) from moisture, but it is rather thin and is only made of galvanized steel. After a year or two, especially if you use highly acidic cleaners which you rinse down your sink, the zinc layer will corrode and expose the steel, which will then also start to corrode, until something hard eventually pokes some kind of hole through the plate somewhere (could be somewhere very small), signaling the end of the machine's service life. The plate is not meant to be repaired, only replaced along with the rest of the unit. That water is getting through to your rotor is an electrical hazard, and should be dealt with immediately (by removing the damaged unit). The manufacturer has figured out that the blades need to me made of stainless steel, but has chosen to skimp on making other interior parts of this more-expensive metal. Good luck!\n"}
{"prompt": "If no power cord is included, how do I plug in the disposal unit? ->", "completion": "I ttok mine off of the broken unit and installed it on the new one.\n"}
{"prompt": "Can someone tell me if this Badger 5 disposer is simple to replace (with my old broken Badger 5)? (i.e. Can I do it myself vs. hiring a plumber ) ->", "completion": "I replaced my a couple of months ago, I'm semi-handy fixing a lot of small stuff around the house. I'm small and in my late seventies, the only problem was holding the unit up in place while turning the locking ring. I no longer have the upper body strength to do it so I used a stack of books. Made sure all the connections were tight and have had so problems since. It clean and in good shape so I left the old badger mount in the sink. Took about forty min, but a lot of that was getting the books.\n"}
{"prompt": "Is this Badger 5 compatible with the Badger 5 model 5-81? Same size and fittings? ->", "completion": "It fit the same as the one we replaced\n"}
{"prompt": "will this one work to replace the badger 1 1/3 HP ->", "completion": "Yes it will. The sink connector is even the same\n"}
{"prompt": "so can this unit be connected with a dishwasher or do I need a different model? ->", "completion": "yes, I did it with mine.\n"}
{"prompt": "How easy to replace existing badger 1 with badger 5? ->", "completion": "Not difficult as long as you have a helper or something to prop up the replacement as you screw it into place.\n"}
{"prompt": "My present disposal has a 3 bolt connection. Would changing to the twist type connection for a new disposal make installation complicated? ->", "completion": "If I understand your present disposal 3 bolts the twist type should be no problem. When you order it is a bit confusing as to what comes with the disposal. When they show people often order some things when the get the disposal. You don't need any of those it all come with it the only thing you might need would be some different drain pipe but most likely you won't. I hope I was some help. Bill\n"}
{"prompt": "Does the unit come with the rubber collar or do I need to buy that separately? ->", "completion": "If you mean the rubber collar that is visible when looking at the drain, with the rubber flaps, then yes it does.\n"}

How's the transfer of heat ->", "completion": "I don't see how it could be used that way, no. I ordered one for that same purpose assuming it was a solid plate, but this is a stamped steel disc with a raised rim for it to slip over a conventional burner.

{"prompt": "How many test kits are there in a box. How mant times can I test the water ->", "completion": "just once. there are several types of test in the box but they're each designed to only be used once.\n"}
{"prompt": "how many strips come in the kit, I need at least 12 ->", "completion": "The kit contains ONE strip per test. So if you want to test 12 water sources you could pool them. A better plan might be to buy two kits and test a pool of 6 water sources for each. That way if one set is positive, you only need to buy 6 more, for a total of 8 kits, rather than 12.\n"}
{"prompt": "can more than one water source be tested? ->", "completion": "no, there is only one test kit for each substance. You could only test two if you mixed them together and did it as a pooled sample.\n"}
{"prompt": "Has anyone used this to test for lead? Do you think it's accurate? ->", "completion": "We used it to test for lead and we have no reason to believe the result was inaccurate. All of its other tests gave results that made me feel like the test was genuine.\n"}
{"prompt": "I thought this had been endorsed by epa or state of OH as a home test option, but now I cannot find that on their websites. Does anyone endorse it? ->", "completion": "The state doesn't have any protocols for rapid screening tests\n"}
{"prompt": "does it have a colour indicator? ->", "completion": "All the tests are based on color . For the lead test, it's a line indicator.\n"}
{"prompt": "Does this kit tell you the amount of nitrates, or just tell you its too high? ->", "completion": "You would need to go through a lab to get the exact amount. With this kit you follow a color chart and compare to the EPA standard\n"}
{"prompt": "Is there an expiration date on any of the tests? ->", "completion": "YES. On the back side of the plastic packaging which houses the contents including the instructions and different package envelopes which contain the chemicals for the variety of tests. There are no dates on the individual test envelopes that I can see. BUT there is definitely an expiration date on the back outside of the clear plastic packaging right next to the words \"Watersafe City Water Test Kit.\" I hope this is a clear explanation and that it helps.\n"}
{"prompt": "does it test Coliform/ E. Coli ?? ->", "completion": "It has a test for bacteria for example E.Coli, however the bacteria test does not specify what kind you have in there.\n"}
{"prompt": "does this test forlead ->", "completion": "Yes it does.\n"}
{"prompt": "filter for vicks3 ->", "completion": "Filter for vicks3 is NOT a question. What are you asking?\n"}
{"prompt": "I have not purchased the humidifier that uses this filter yet, but on average how long does this filter last a rough estimate? ->", "completion": "The outer shell will fall apart in about a year of use, but the filter itself can survive much longer. Mine split at the seam, so it's no longer round, but it still fits in the humidifier, and does its job. Cleaning the filter every week (especially if you have hard water) will degrade the material over time. I've used one in this manner for 3 years so far.\n"}
{"prompt": "I need to replace a Holmes wick HWF-65T. Does this filter fit? ->", "completion": "The only humidifiers that this will fit are Sunbeam SCM866, SCM1895, and SCM1896 and Holmes HM1865 and HM1895 according to the filter box. So I think the answer to your question is \"No\". Sorry.\n"}
{"prompt": "will this be replacement for holmes model hm 1745 filter? Dimensions 61/2 x 19 x 1 ->", "completion": "Its generic and does not work in a Holmes humidifier!!!\n"}
{"prompt": "I would like to buy at least 5 filters. Could I pay 1 shipping price if you bundle it? Thank you. ->", "completion": "Hi: yes, we would bundle all 5 filters and charge one shipping price.\n"}
{"prompt": "Is this model for the #1855 Holmes humidifier? ->", "completion": "its for the hwf65. I see other vendors do have the filter with the black mesh like the picture shows.\n"}
{"prompt": "does this filter fit the Holmes HM1845? ->", "completion": "All I know is that I have an older model of the Holmes room humidifier. it doesn't have any code on it. anyway, the filter was too tall, but it did fit. so I cut it in half (very hard to do with chic hands. but I did it) and now I have 2 filters for the price of one! other than all that, I'm happy w/it.\n"}

{"prompt": "The filters I received did not have the black on the outside. What is the black for? ->", "completion": "I'm not an expert. Let me start to answer your question with a question. Is there an outer core in any other color that is made of a different material than the inner core? The inner core (white in the picture) is softer to the touch; the outer core, I suspect is what helps it stand up. I don't think the color matters. The outer core feels like plastic. The inner core is definitely not plastic. I suspect the color does not matter. If this doesn't completely answer your question, ask away. I enjoy doing this.\n"}
{"prompt": "does it fit HM1700? I see someone left same question but I dont see answer. ->", "completion": "I just googled it and it says this filter works for it.\n"}
{"prompt": "Does it work with Kenmore humidifier? ->", "completion": "Yes it does.\n"}
{"prompt": "Do I need to tear off the black outside before I put the new filter into the machine? ->", "completion": "No. That is part of the filter and provides support.\n"}
{"prompt": "Does this filter fit the Holmes hm5100? ->", "completion": "yes\n"}
{"prompt": "Anyone have issues with the filter rotting? Or smelling really bad after a few weeks of use? ->", "completion": "Don't have an issue with the filter rotting or smelling bad after usage. If you don't plan on using it much, the water container should be emptied and the filter dried out.\n"}
{"prompt": "Brand new only a month old and filter is brown and dired put? ->", "completion": "Your water may have a high mineral content. Please be sure to always have water in the unit to prevent the filter from drying. Also, we recommend changing the wick filter every 4 weeks.\n"}
{"prompt": "Can this filter remove all mold spores ->", "completion": "I suppose so if you keep it clean I get a new filter each year\n"}

{"prompt": "Is this the same bulb as the EUV-13B? ->", "completion": "i have no idea\n"}
{"prompt": "Will this bulb work for a slant/fin GF-220? Thanks, Michael. ->", "completion": "I have the GF 300 and I use a EUV-13B bulb and this bulb is specifically rated for the GF 220. You can get it right here at Amazon and it costs only $9.00.\n"}
{"prompt": "Can you tell what base this bulb has, Med, Min or sub min. ->", "completion": "Sorry, don't really know the differences!?!?\n"}

{"prompt": "What are the different colored round \"things\" for and do they show or do they go underneath the knobs? Thanks ->", "completion": "They are to make the knobs fit,but the knobs kept falling off even with those.\n"}
{"prompt": "Do you have to hold down the IS button or does it stay on after you press it one time? ->", "completion": "They did not work on my stove,\n"}

{"prompt": "I need a device to let my dryer vent out, I live in small apt, very hot-humid weather, No AC. Would u recommend me this? ->", "completion": "This vent is used indoor where there is no way to vent outside. As long as you are sure there is always water in the trap - it works fine. You will have some humidity, but no worse than anything else.\n"}

{"prompt": "How many loads can you wash before it needs emptied? ->", "completion": "I empty it out every single load. You can probably get two loads, unless it is something that produces a lot of lint.\n"}
{"prompt": "How many loads can you wash before it needs emptied? ->", "completion": "I would check it after every dryer run. The water evaporates quickly.\n"}
{"prompt": "Does it have screens in place where the vents are to prevent lint from blowing out of the vent holes? ->", "completion": "No. The way it works is that the tray is about half full of water (there is a line you fill it up to). The air hits the water and that catches MOST of the lint. It isn't 100% effective - a little still flies out. But it is a good bit more effective than you'd think it would be. I think it basically gets the lint wet enough that it is too heavy to escape. Remember this is only catching the lint that the lint screen inside the dryer missed - it isn't anything like the amount per load you pull out of the dryer lint screen.\n"}
{"prompt": "can it be used for a gas drier ->", "completion": "I don't really know as this didn't work out for us. I guess I didn't read the description well enough to know you needed to keep water in the boxt. It was going to be too difficult for us to constantly do that. However, I don't see why not it wouldn't work as the hose comes out of the dryer and into the little box. Surely if it can't be used for a gas dryer, they would put that in the description. Sorry I could not be of more help.\n"}
{"prompt": "Will the LTF Lint Dryer Kit work on a gas dryer? ->", "completion": "I believe there's a disclaimer on these units that they should not be used on gas dryers. Gas dryers really need to be vented outdoors because, unlike electric dryers, there's combustion and that results in fumes. The other vent shown with this one... Dundas Jafine TDIDVKZW ProFlex Indoor Dryer Vent Kit... states in the description \"Not be used with gas clothes dryers\". I would not do it.\n"}
{"prompt": "Sink connection question: Has anyone had this problem and figured out a way to solve it? ->", "completion": "Hello, I suggest that you take the aeroators off both kitchen and bathroom faucet, take them AND the adapter to home depot or lowes. In the bathroom section, they sell what is called AERATOR ADAPTERS. Ask one of the staff to help you and your problem will be resolved quickly.\n"}
{"prompt": "The water flows through the inlet hose without a problem and is connected tightly. However, the water does not flow into the tub. Why is this? ->", "completion": "Can you clarify? Is the water not flowing from the *machine* tub into your *shower* tub where you're draining into? Or is water not coming into the Haier tub? Your question is hard to answer as I'm not sure which tub the water isn't going into, but if you can clarify, we can probably help figure this out for you.\n"}
{"prompt": "How many RPM (revolutions per minute) has this washer? Does anyone know? ->", "completion": "hi. i don't know about rpm's, but my (new) washer spins clothes almost dry! it's great in that way and in many others...i just can't seem to get the lint filter out to clean it.\n"}
{"prompt": "lint screen stuck/broken: Any suggestions? ->", "completion": "Pull from the side and bend it forward - it should pop out. My washer is not spinning the water out correctly - the pulsator is moving but it is not moving reapidly as it once was and now the clothes are full of water -- the washer drains without problem - it just does not seem to be spinning out correctly - any ideas ?

{"prompt": "does it have a backlight? ->", "completion": "No, I wish it did! Can't read it when baby's sleeping.\n"}
{"prompt": "Is it possible to calibrate ->", "completion": "I can see NO apparent way for the user to calibrate the monitor. Still, a pretty nice unit for the price.\n"}
{"prompt": "Anyone know how accurate the humidity measurements are? (Ie: anyone checked this against some standard or some other accurate hygrometer?) Thanks! ->", "completion": "Seemed pretty accurate to me, had another digital in the room and they read the same\n"}
{"prompt": "It's written that the dimensions are 7x7x4inches. Is it right? ->", "completion": "Good catch. It is in fact more like 4 x 4 inches. Probably 7 centimeters.\n"}
{"prompt": "Is it accurate? ->", "completion": "Relative to the thermostat setting and a baby monitor - yes. I don't know about humidity other than to say two of the same Vicks monitors read the same and trend with outside humidity.\n"}
{"prompt": "Is there a lag time after you take it out of the box before it starts to work? (No instructions included!) ->", "completion": "Nope. As soon as I took the plastic piece of te battery compartment it started working.\n"}
{"prompt": "Could this be used outside in a enclosed patio and work accurately throughout the seasons? Thank you for your reply and have a good day! ->", "completion": "Yes, should be fine\n"}
{"prompt": "Does this monitor read humidity levels below 16%? ->", "completion": "The scale listed on the unit goes from 0 to 100, so I imagine it would. Ours has only ever been down in the lower 20s.\n"}
{"prompt": "can it be wall mounted ->", "completion": "No.\n"}
{"prompt": "I sure need to know if this can be used on a rock/stone yard to pick up leaf debris but leaves behind the decorative stone? ->", "completion": "If the leaves are dry, it should do fine...and leave the stone undisturbed. I have used it for this purpose with little, if any, problem.\n"}
{"prompt": "Has anyone used this on a brick driveway? I am looking for vacuum that can suck-up small leaves and other debris between the bricks. ->", "completion": "I bought this originally to sweep up sawdust in my woodshop. I have used this to sweep the pavers in my backyard and it works great. It has a lot of suction power.\n"}
{"prompt": "does this pick up dust without blowing it out the bag. Our barn is very dusty ->", "completion": "I use are in a warehouse for the dust. I have found that you need to wash out the bag after use. I rinse the bag out with water and hang to dry for the next week.\n"}
{"prompt": "I'm assuming this is a electrical plug in rather than gas powered correct? ->", "completion": "Yes you are correct, it is electric 120 volt.

If you have a regular shop vac I would recommend you try it first. It will definitely NOT be equivalent to an upright indoor vacuum on carpet. It just won't be that easy. You need a level surface. If your lawn is really thick it \"could\" help. If the lawn is sparse you would probably hurt the grass.\n"}

{"prompt": "Should this filter be replaced every year? If not, how do you clean it? ->", "completion": "Hi Marlene, First I should point out this product is not really a filter. It's a wick that absorbs and holds moisture so the blower fan can push air through it and drive the water into the surrounding environment. How often it needs replacing depends upon how often the humidifier cycles and on the mineral content of your water. If you run your humidifier a lot and you are not using filtered water, then these wicks typically need replacing about every three months (at least). I use filtered water in my humidifier to reduce the mineral content but I still have to replace the wick every 5-6 months. It's pretty simple to determine when your wick is clogged with minerals because the humidifier will basically run non-stop as there will be no moisture in the wick therefore no moisture going into the air. These wicks are not really cleanable because they are too fragile. Once they get clogged with minerals (i.e. \"lime\") they need to be disposed of and replaced.\n"}
