open-ended,B0002YTM0I,"Dec 5, 2013",1386230400.0,"Non-Ducted range Hood, does this mean there is no need to vent up thru the roof or out thru the wall?",,That's correct. The air flows through the filter on the underside and out through the three columns of vent slats you see on the front of the range hood. There is no connection to other vents or ducts in a wall or through the roof.,Appliances

Chances are that if you don't have the pre wired design that I had, you will need a power cord kit if you plan to physically plug the unit into a traditional wall socket.",Appliances

Or do anything I need to install range hood come with it?,,"As I recall, it came with all the necessary hardware. You'll need tools like a drill and screwdriver, of course. I needed to add some wood furring strips to the underside of my cabinet to make it a flush mount, but I had the wood at home already, so I didn't need to purchase any.",Appliances

yes/no,B0002YTM0I,"Nov 7, 2013",1383811200.0,Is the charcoal filter a separate accessory from the aluminium mesh?,?,"The filter that came with the range hood was a one-piece unit, with the aluminum mesh on the exposed side and the filtering material inside. The filtering material against the aluminum mesh is black (carbon fiber?); the backside is blue. There are no grains of carbon, as there used to be in the 2-piece filter for my old range hood.",Appliances
yes/no,B0002YTM0I,"Dec 18, 2014",1418889600.0,I want to mount it to the wall with no cabinet above it using L brackets. Would this be ok to do?,Y,"If only L brackets are used in the back, I'd say no. There's extra holes in the top and rear so at minimum, I'd secure the rear to wall studs with extra screws. The weight is more center/front and my concern is over time it would droop forward. It's designed to mount under a cabinet. If there is something to mount the sides to it would work better.",Appliances
open-ended,B0002YTM0I,"Jun 10, 2014",1402383600.0,what type of cover is over the light bulb ?,,"It's just a plastic diffuser. It locks into a couple of slots in the hood.

open-ended,B0002YTLZY,"Mar 13, 2014",1394694000.0,what is the CFM or power?,,"The Broan 4130 is not rated for CFM because it is a non ducted hood. Probably about 100-150 cfm fan, 2850 rpm. You don't want too much air blowing back in your face anyway. I hope this helps.",Appliances
yes/no,B0002YTLZY,"Apr 2, 2014",1396422000.0,does it come with a power cord/,N,No. Unfortunately you would have to purchase the cord at a home depo or any hardware store for about $5.,Appliances
yes/no,B0002YTLZY,"Sep 3, 2013",1378191600.0,I have no above cabinet......can I install on wall???,?,"I wouldn't. There are 4 holes on the back, but the metal of the hood isn't very thick and wouldn't support much weight. A cheap solution would be to get piece of shelving the size of the hood with two brackets mounted to the wall upside down and mount the hood to the bottom of the shelf. This will give you some extra storage space as well.",Appliances

The fittings have a very good rubber washer, which will hold up for years to come. These hoses have a 5 year warranty, but will last for a lot more than that. Braided hoses are the best for any kind of plumbing, as they are not prone to bursting, like none braided hoses are. Fluidmaster is the best brand.",Appliances
