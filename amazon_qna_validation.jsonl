{"prompt": "Non-Ducted range Hood, does this mean there is no need to vent up thru the roof or out thru the wall? ->", "completion": "That's correct. The air flows through the filter on the underside and out through the three columns of vent slats you see on the front of the range hood. There is no connection to other vents or ducts in a wall or through the roof.\n"}
{"prompt": "I will be plugging the rangehood into the wall, will I need a power cord kit? ->", "completion": "I'm not sure what your setup is, but when I did mine, I hardwired the hood into the existing black and white wires that were used in the old hood. Chances are that if you don't have the pre wired design that I had, you will need a power cord kit if you plan to physically plug the unit into a traditional wall socket.\n"}
{"prompt": "Is this actual stainless steel or painted? Has anyone noticed any problems with rusting? Thanks. ->", "completion": "Its painted and no I haven't noticed any problems with rust. It really looks nice in my kitchen and the price was awesome. I would recommend it.\n"}
{"prompt": "Hi, the specification says it is 30 inch. My old range is actually 29.75 inch. Has anyone actually measured the exact length? 30 inch won't fit. ->", "completion": "i agree with aaron 29 7/8\n"}
{"prompt": "This is my first range hood. Do I need to purchase anything else with this purchase? Or do anything I need to install range hood come with it? ->", "completion": "As I recall, it came with all the necessary hardware. You'll need tools like a drill and screwdriver, of course. I needed to add some wood furring strips to the underside of my cabinet to make it a flush mount, but I had the wood at home already, so I didn't need to purchase any.\n"}
{"prompt": "Does this come with the filter or do I have to buy filter separtely ->", "completion": "Yes, mine did\n"}
{"prompt": "Is the charcoal filter a separate accessory from the aluminium mesh? ->", "completion": "The filter that came with the range hood was a one-piece unit, with the aluminum mesh on the exposed side and the filtering material inside. The filtering material against the aluminum mesh is black (carbon fiber?); the backside is blue. There are no grains of carbon, as there used to be in the 2-piece filter for my old range hood.\n"}
{"prompt": "I want to mount it to the wall with no cabinet above it using L brackets. Would this be ok to do? ->", "completion": "If only L brackets are used in the back, I'd say no. There's extra holes in the top and rear so at minimum, I'd secure the rear to wall studs with extra screws. The weight is more center/front and my concern is over time it would droop forward. It's designed to mount under a cabinet. If there is something to mount the sides to it would work better.\n"}
{"prompt": "what type of cover is over the light bulb ? ->", "completion": "It's just a plastic diffuser. It locks into a couple of slots in the hood. You squeeze the two sides together to release tabs on the sides of the diffuser from the slots in the hood. Takes a standard base, 60watt or small CFL bulb.\n"}
{"prompt": "can anyone please tell me what the depth of the unit is from the back to just where the grills and switches are. ->", "completion": "12\".\n"}
{"prompt": "what is the CFM or power? ->", "completion": "The Broan 4130 is not rated for CFM because it is a non ducted hood. Probably about 100-150 cfm fan, 2850 rpm. You don't want too much air blowing back in your face anyway. I hope this helps.\n"}
{"prompt": "does it come with a power cord/ ->", "completion": "No. Unfortunately you would have to purchase the cord at a home depo or any hardware store for about $5.\n"}
{"prompt": "I have no above cabinet......can I install on wall??? ->", "completion": "I wouldn't. There are 4 holes on the back, but the metal of the hood isn't very thick and wouldn't support much weight. A cheap solution would be to get piece of shelving the size of the hood with two brackets mounted to the wall upside down and mount the hood to the bottom of the shelf. This will give you some extra storage space as well.\n"}
{"prompt": "Does it get rid of kitchen smoke...that's what I need. My kitchen doesn't have an exhaust fan and every time I cook it smokes up the house. ->", "completion": "Yes it does. I don't have an exhaust fan either, so this takes care of it. Diana D.\n"}
{"prompt": "Can this be powered from an outlet plug or do I have to hard-wire it in? ->", "completion": "Use \"Broan HCK44 Power Cord Kit on individual display card\" by Broan-NuTone Amazon $8.97 3 ft cord to convert from hard wired.\n"}
{"prompt": "It comes with a carbon filter? ->", "completion": "No\n"}
{"prompt": "does it plug in to a regular 110 outlet? ->", "completion": "It could. It didn't come with wire or a plug but it's VERY simple. If you have ever replaced an outlet or the plug end of a cord you can install this.\n"}
{"prompt": "Is the hood exactly 30\" wide? Our space above the range is just under 30\", and I'm afraid we'll have to order the 24\" if the dimensions are exact. ->", "completion": "Yes, it is 30\" wide. Thanks.\n"}
{"prompt": "How much clearence do I need to leave above the stovetop? ->", "completion": "Mine is like 18\" from the stove top.\n"}
{"prompt": "Can you clean spattered egg yolk off of it? Mine is uncleanable and it's white! ->", "completion": "No\n"}
{"prompt": "How long have you had your hoses and have you experienced any leaks or leaking fittings? ->", "completion": "I've had my hoses for a few months, and I have not had any leaking, at all. The fittings have a very good rubber washer, which will hold up for years to come. These hoses have a 5 year warranty, but will last for a lot more than that. Braided hoses are the best for any kind of plumbing, as they are not prone to bursting, like none braided hoses are. Fluidmaster is the best brand.\n"}
{"prompt": "Does this ship with a quantity of two hoses for the current listed price? ->", "completion": "yes\n"}
{"prompt": "Are they color coded ? Red for hot blue for cold ? ->", "completion": "No they are not\n"}
{"prompt": "What is the inside diameter of these hoses? ->", "completion": "I think it was 1/2\". They work fine.\n"}
{"prompt": "Will original drawers work with this in a GE model TBX14SYXKLWH? ->", "completion": "I believe so, mine did just fine.\n"}
